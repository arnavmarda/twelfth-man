# Twelfth Man

#### By Lightning Sharks

--

Twelfth Man is a web application that aims to act as a hosting platform for cricket games. We provide features to create player profiles, teams, matches, tournaments, as well as score games. 

## Motivations

As some of us are avid cricket players and enthusiasts, we found that an application like this would greatly help ease the otherwise tedious manual process of scoring a cricket game. We also added some other special features including creating user profiles, teams, tournaments and more!

## Installation

Once you have cloned the repository into your desired folder, perform the following steps:

1. Install packages in the main directory:

```bash
npm install
```

1. Change directory to the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Change directory to the backend:

```bash
cd ../backend
```

4. Install required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Change back to the main directory and start:

```bash
cd ..
npm start
```

The webpage should now be open in your default browser
